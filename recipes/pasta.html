    <ul><h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>All-Purposr Flour (2 cups)</li>
        <li>Eggs (2)</li>
        <li>Olive Oil (1 Tbs) </li>
        <li>Salt (1/2 Ts)</li>
        <li>Water (optional if dry)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h4>Instructions</h4>
        <li>Prepare the Flour: On a clean work surface, make a mound with the flour. Create a well in the center of the mound.</li>
        <li>Add Eggs: Crack the eggs into the well. If you’re using olive oil and salt, add them to the well with the eggs.</li>
        <li>Mix the Dough: Using a fork, gently beat the eggs and gradually start incorporating the flour from the edges of the well. Continue until the dough starts to come together.</li>
        <li>Knead the Dough: Once the mixture is too thick to mix with a fork, use your hands to knead the dough. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour. If it’s too dry, add a small amount of water, a teaspoon at a time.</li>
        <li>Rest the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This relaxes the gluten and makes it easier to roll out.</li>
        <li>Roll and Cut the Dough: After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Roll each portion out on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8 inch thick using a rolling pin. </li>
        <li>Cut into Strips: Cut the rolled-out dough into thin strips about 1/4 inch wide and 4-5 inches long.</li>
        <li><em>SKIP TO Shaping the Rotini BEFOR THIS</em> Dry the Pasta: Let the shaped pasta dry for about 30 minutes to an hour before cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rotini and cook for 2-4 minutes or until al dente (fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried pasta). Drain and serve.</li>
    </ol>
        
        
        
            <ol><strong>Shaping the Rotini</strong>
                <li>Take each strip and wrap it around a thin rod or skewer, creating a spiral shape.</li>
                <li>Carefully slide the formed rotini off the rod or skewer and place them on a lightly floured surface or a drying rack.</li>
                <li>If you don't have a rod or skewer, you can twist the strips by hand to form the rotini shape, though it might take a bit of practice to get the perfect shape.</li>
            </ol>
